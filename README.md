# Simple Plagiarism Detection Utility using String Matching Algorithms

#### How to use the palagrisim detection utility:

	1. You need to change the paths of the files in both taking_input_text() function and taking_input_pattern() function to the path of the folder that contains your files.
	2. You need to adjust the value of the global variable num_text_files to the number of text files you want.  
	3. You need to adjust the value of the global variable num_pat_files to the number of pattern files you want. 
	4. You need to update the names of the pattern documents in the pat_files[] array and update the names of the text files in the text_files[] array. 
	5. Run the algorithm to enjoy the output.
